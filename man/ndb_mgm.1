ndb_mgm \- the MySQL Cluster management client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBndb_mgm\ \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\ 'u
\fBndb_mgm \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBndb_mgm\fR
management client process is actually not needed to run the cluster\&. Its value lies in providing a set of commands for checking the cluster\'s status, starting backups, and performing other administrative functions\&. The management client accesses the management server using a C API\&. Advanced users can also employ this API for programming dedicated management processes to perform tasks similar to those performed by
\fBndb_mgm\fR\&.
.PP
To start the management client, it is necessary to supply the host name and port number of the management server:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm [\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR\fB]]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm ndb_mgmd\&.mysql\&.com 1186\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The default host name and port number are
localhost
and 1186, respectively\&.

If the connection to the management server is broken, the node tries to reconnect to it every 5 seconds until it succeeds\&. By using this option, it is possible to limit the number of attempts to
\fInumber\fR
before giving up and reporting an error instead\&.
