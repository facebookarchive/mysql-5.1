.PP
The cluster restoration program is implemented as a separate command\-line utility
\fBndb_restore\fR, which can normally be found in the MySQL
bin
directory\&. This program reads the files created as a result of the backup and inserts the stored information into the database\&.
.PP
\fBndb_restore\fR
must be executed once for each of the backup files that were created by the
START BACKUP
command used to create the backup (see
Section\ \&17.5.3.2, \(lqUsing The MySQL Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup\(rq)\&. This is equal to the number of data nodes in the cluster at the time that the backup was created\&.

Before using
\fBndb_restore\fR, it is recommended that the cluster be running in single user mode, unless you are restoring multiple data nodes in parallel\&. See
Section\ \&17.5.6, \(lqMySQL Cluster Single User Mode\(rq, for more information about single user mode\&.

The following table includes options that are specific to the MySQL Cluster backup restoration program
\fBndb_restore\fR\&. Additional descriptions follow the table\&. For options common to all MySQL Cluster programs, see
Section\ \&17.4.2, \(lqOptions Common to MySQL Cluster Programs\(rq\&.
.PP
Typical options for this utility are shown here:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_restore [\-c \fIconnectstring\fR] \-n
\fInode_id\fR [\-s] [\-m] \-b \fIbackup_id\fR \-r \-\-backup_path=\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR [\-e]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
option is used to specify a connectstring which tells
ndb_restore
where to locate the cluster management server\&. (See
Section\ \&17.3.2.3, \(lqThe MySQL Cluster Connectstring\(rq, for information on connectstrings\&.) If this option is not used, then
\fBndb_restore\fR
attempts to connect to a management server on
localhost:1186\&. This utility acts as a cluster API node, and so requires a free connection
\(lqslot\(rq
to connect to the cluster management server\&. This means that there must be at least one
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section that can be used by it in the cluster
config\&.ini
file\&. It is a good idea to keep at least one empty
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section in
config\&.ini
that is not being used for a MySQL server or other application for this reason (see
Section\ \&17.3.2.7, \(lqDefining SQL and Other API Nodes in a MySQL Cluster\(rq)\&.
.PP
You can verify that
\fBndb_restore\fR
is connected to the cluster by using the
\fBSHOW\fR
command in the
\fBndb_mgm\fR
management client\&. You can also accomplish this from a system shell, as shown here:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm \-e "SHOW"\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fB\-n\fR
is used to specify the node ID of the data node on which the backups were taken\&.
.PP
The first time you run the
\fBndb_restore\fR
restoration program, you also need to restore the metadata\&. In other words, you must re\-create the database tables \(em this can be done by running it with the
\fB\-m\fR
option\&. Note that the cluster should have an empty database when starting to restore a backup\&. (In other words, you should start
\fBndbd\fR
with
\fB\-\-initial\fR
prior to performing the restore\&. You should also remove manually any Disk Data files present in the data node\'s
DataDir\&.)
.PP
It is possible to restore data without restoring table metadata\&. Prior to MySQL 5\&.1\&.17,
\fBndb_restore\fR
did not perform any checks of table schemas; if a table was altered between the time the backup was taken and when
\fBndb_restore\fR
was run,
\fBndb_restore\fR
would still attempt to restore the data to the altered table\&.
.PP
Beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.17, the default behavior is for
\fBndb_restore\fR
to fail with an error if table data do not match the table schema; this can be overridden using the
\fB\-\-skip\-table\-check\fR
or
\fB\-s\fR
option\&. Prior to MySQL 5\&.1\&.21, if this option is used, then
\fBndb_restore\fR
attempts to fit data into the existing table schema, but the result of restoring a backup to a table schema that does not match the original is unspecified\&.
.PP
.\" attribute promotion: ndb_restore
.\" ndb_restore: attribute promotion
Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.3\&.8,
\fBndb_restore\fR
supports limited
attribute promotion
in much the same way that it is supported by MySQL replication; that is, data backed up from a column of a given type can generally be restored to a column using a
\(lqlarger, similar\(rq
type\&. For example, data from a
CHAR(20)
column can be restored to a column declared as
VARCHAR(20),
VARCHAR(30), or
CHAR(30); data from a
MEDIUMINT
column can be restored to a column of type
INT
or
BIGINT\&. See
Section\ \&16.3.1.5.2, \(lqReplication of Columns Having Different Data Types\(rq, for a table of type conversions currently supported by attribute promotion\&.
.PP
Attribute promotion by
\fBndb_restore\fR
must be enabled explicitly, as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
Prepare the table to which the backup is to be restored\&.
\fBndb_restore\fR
cannot be used to re\-create the table with a different definition from the original; this means that you must either create the table manually, or alter the columns which you wish to promote using
ALTER TABLE
after restoring the table metadata but before restoring the data\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Invoke
\fBndb_restore\fR
with the
\fB\-\-promote\-attributes\fR
option (short form
\fB\-A\fR) when restoring the table data\&. Attribute promotion does not occur if this option is not used; instead, the restore operation fails with an error\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
In addition to
\fB\-\-promote\-attributes\fR, a
\fB\-\-preserve\-trailing\-spaces\fR
option is also available for use with
\fBndb_restore\fR
beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.3\&.8\&. This option (short form
\fB\-R\fR) causes trailing spaces to be preserved when promoting a
CHAR
column to
VARCHAR
or a
BINARY
column to
VARBINARY\&. Otherwise, any trailing spaces are dropped from column values when they are inserted into the new columns\&.

When restoring cluster backups, you must be sure to restore all data nodes from backups having the same backup ID\&. Using files from different backups will at best result in restoring the cluster to an inconsistent state, and may fail altogether\&.
.sp .5v

.PP
\fB\-e\fR
adds (or restores) epoch information to the cluster replication status table\&. This is useful for starting replication on a MySQL Cluster replication slave\&. When this option is used, the row in the
mysql\&.ndb_apply_status
having
0
in the
id
column is updated if it already exists; such a row is inserted if it does not already exist\&. (See
Section\ \&17.6.9, \(lqMySQL Cluster Backups With MySQL Cluster Replication\(rq\&.)
.PP
The path to the backup directory is required; this is supplied to
\fBndb_restore\fR
using the
\fB\-\-backup_path\fR
option, and must include the subdirectory corresponding to the ID backup of the backup to be restored\&. For example, if the data node\'s
DataDir
is
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster, then the backup directory is
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster/BACKUP, and the backup files for the backup with the ID 3 can be found in
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP\-3\&. The path may be absolute or relative to the directory in which the
\fBndb_restore\fR
executable is located, and may be optionally prefixed with
\fBbackup_path=\fR\&.

Previous to MySQL 5\&.1\&.17 and MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.1\&.5, the path to the backup directory was specified as shown here, with
\fBbackup_path=\fR
being optional:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[backup_path=]\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
Beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.17 and MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.1\&.5, this syntax changed to
\fB\-\-backup_path=\fR\fB\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR\fR, to conform more closely with options used by other MySQL programs;
\fB\-\-backup_id\fR
is required, and there is no short form for this option\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
It is possible to restore a backup to a database with a different configuration than it was created from\&. For example, suppose that a backup with backup ID
12, created in a cluster with two database nodes having the node IDs
2
and
3, is to be restored to a cluster with four nodes\&. Then
\fBndb_restore\fR
must be run twice \(em once for each database node in the cluster where the backup was taken\&. However,
\fBndb_restore\fR
cannot always restore backups made from a cluster running one version of MySQL to a cluster running a different MySQL version\&. See
Section\ \&17.2.6.2, \(lqMySQL Cluster 5.1 and MySQL Cluster NDB 6.x/7.x Upgrade and Downgrade Compatibility\(rq, for more information\&.

It is not possible to restore a backup made from a newer version of MySQL Cluster using an older version of
\fBndb_restore\fR\&. You can restore a backup made from a newer version of MySQL to an older cluster, but you must use a copy of
\fBndb_restore\fR
from the newer MySQL Cluster version to do so\&.
.PP
For example, to restore a cluster backup taken from a cluster running MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.2\&.15 to a cluster running MySQL 5\&.1\&.20, you must use a copy of
\fBndb_restore\fR
from the MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.2\&.15 distribution\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
For more rapid restoration, the data may be restored in parallel, provided that there is a sufficient number of cluster connections available\&. That is, when restoring to multiple nodes in parallel, you must have an
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section in the cluster
config\&.ini
file available for each concurrent
\fBndb_restore\fR
process\&. However, the data files must always be applied before the logs\&.
.PP
Formerly, when using
\fBndb_restore\fR
to restore a backup made from a MySQL 5\&.0 cluster to a 5\&.1 cluster,
VARCHAR
columns were not resized and were recreated using the 5\&.0 fixed format\&. Beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.19,
ndb_restore
recreates such
VARCHAR
columns using MySQL Cluster 5\&.1\'s variable\-width format\&. Also beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.19, this behavior can be overridden using the
\fB\-\-no\-upgrade\fR
option (short form:
\fB\-u\fR) when running
\fBndb_restore\fR\&.

Beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.18, it is possible to restore selected databases, or to restore selected tables from a given database using the syntax shown here:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_restore \fIother_options\fR \fIdb_name_1\fR [\fIdb_name_2\fR[, \fIdb_name_3\fR][, \&.\&.\&.] | \fItbl_name_1\fR[, \fItbl_name_2\fR][, \&.\&.\&.]]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
In other words, you can specify either of the following to be restored:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.3\&.22 and 6\&.4\&.3, you can (and should) use instead the options
\fB\-\-include\-databases\fR
and
\fB\-\-include\-tables\fR
for restoring only specific databases or tables, respectively\&.
\fB\-\-include\-databases\fR
takes a comma\-delimited list of databases to be restored\&.
\fB\-\-include\-tables\fR
takes a comma\-delimited list of tables (in
\fIdatabase\fR\&.\fItable\fR
format) to be restored\&. You can use these two options together\&. For example, the following causes all tables in databases
db1
and
db2, together with the tables
t1
and
t2
in database
db3, to be restored (and no other databases or tables):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

(For the sake of clarity and brevity, we have omitted other, possibly required, options in the example just shown\&.) When
\fB\-\-include\-databases\fR,
\fB\-\-include\-tables\fR, or both are used, only those databases or tables specified are restored; all other databases and tables are ignored by
\fBndb_restore\fR\&.
.PP
Also beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.3\&.22 and 6\&.4\&.3, it is possible to exclude from being restored one or more databases, tables, or both using the
\fBndb_restore\fR
options
\fB\-\-exclude\-databases\fR
and
\fB\-\-exclude\-tables\fR\&.
\fB\-\-exclude\-databases\fR
takes a comma\-delimited list of one or more databases which should not be restored\&.
\fB\-\-exclude\-tables\fR
takes a comma\-delimited list of one or more tables, using
\fIdatabase\fR\&.\fItable\fR
format, which should not be restored\&. You can use these two options together\&. For example, the following causes all tables in all databases
\fIexcept for\fR
databases
db1
and
db2, along with the tables
t1
and
t2
in database
db3,
\fInot\fR
to be restored:

(Again, we have omitted other possibly necessary options in the interest of clarity and brevity from the example just shown\&.)

You should not use
\fB\-\-include\-databases\fR
or
\fB\-\-include\-tables\fR
together with
\fB\-\-exclude\-databases\fR
or
\fB\-\-exclude\-tables\fR, since
\fB\-\-include\-databases\fR
and
\fB\-\-include\-tables\fR
exclude all databases and tables not explicitly named\&. Similarly,
\fB\-\-exclude\-databases\fR
and
\fB\-\-exclude\-tables\fR
include all databases and tables not listed in the arguments to these options\&.
.\" ndb_restore: --exclude-missing-columns option
.\" --exclude-missing-columns option (ndb_restore)
.PP
Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6\&.3\&.26 and MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0\&.7, it is also possible restore only selected table columns using the
\fB\-\-exclude\-missing\-columns\fR
option\&. When this option is used,
\fBndb_restore\fR
ignores any columns missing from tables being restored as compared to the versions of those tables found in the backup\&. This option applies to all tables being restored\&. If you wish to apply this option only to selected tables or databases, you can use it in combination with one or more of the options described in the previous paragraph to do so, then restore data to the remaining tables using a complementary set of these options\&.
.\" ndb_restore: errors
.PP
\fBError reporting\fR. 
\fBndb_restore\fR
reports both temporary and permanent errors\&. In the case of temporary errors, it may able to recover from them\&. Beginning with MySQL 5\&.1\&.12, it reports
Restore successful, but encountered temporary error, please look at configuration
in such cases\&.

After using
\fBndb_restore\fR
to initialize a MySQL Cluster for use in circular replication, binary logs on the SQL node acting as the replication slave are not automatically created, and you must cause them to be created manually\&. In order to cause the binary logs to be created, issue a
SHOW TABLES
statement on that SQL node before running
START SLAVE\&.
.PP
This is a known issue with MySQL Cluster management, which we intend to address in a future release\&.
